# AI GTM Intelligence Engine

Hey there! This is my take on improving Descope's GTM engine. Instead of just tweaking what already exists, I built something that actually goes out and finds prospects before they even know they need your help.

## What This Thing Actually Does

You know how sales teams spend forever researching companies, trying to figure out who might need your product? This engine does that automatically, but way smarter. It crawls GitHub repos looking for crappy authentication code, monitors Reddit for people complaining about their login systems, and spots companies posting "urgent security engineer needed" jobs.

Then it takes all that intel and generates personalized outreach that doesn't suck - emails that reference their actual GitHub issues, LinkedIn messages that mention their Reddit posts, even video scripts that address their specific pain points.

**Best part?** It runs completely free using local AI. No OpenAI bills, no API costs.

## Why I Built It This Way

The current approach of waiting for leads to come to you is backwards. By the time someone fills out a contact form, they've already talked to your competitors. This engine finds companies when they're just starting to realize they have a problem - before they're actively shopping around.

Instead of generic "Hey, wanna see a demo?" messages, you get stuff like:
- "I noticed your auth service repo has some OAuth implementation questions..."
- "Saw your team discussing SSO headaches on Reddit..."
- "Looks like you're hiring for identity management - we just helped a similar company..."

## How to Actually Use It

### Quick Start (2 minutes)
```bash
# Clone it
git clone <your-repo>
cd Descope-AI-GTM-Take-Home

# Set it up
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the demo
python demo.py
```

That's it. It works right out of the box with smart mock responses.

### For Real Usage
If you want the full experience with actual AI:

1. **Install Ollama** (5 minutes, completely free)
   - Go to ollama.ai and download it
   - Run: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`
   - Done. You now have local AI.

2. **Try the Dashboard**
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```
   
   You get a proper interface where you can add companies, see their scores, generate outreach campaigns, and monitor alerts in real-time.

### What You'll See

The engine analyzes companies and gives them a "GTM score" out of 100. Higher scores mean better prospects. It shows you exactly why each company scored what it did - their tech stack, the signals it found, their hiring patterns, all that good stuff.

For high-scoring companies, you can generate entire outreach campaigns with one click. It creates personalized emails, LinkedIn messages, and even video scripts based on the actual intelligence it gathered.

## The Technical Bits

- **main.py**: The core engine that does all the analysis
- **ai_providers.py**: Handles different AI providers (Ollama, Groq, etc.)
- **dashboard.py**: The web interface built with Streamlit
- **monitoring.py**: Real-time monitoring and alerts
- **integrations.py**: Connects to GitHub, Reddit, and other APIs

Everything's async so it's fast, modular so you can extend it, and documented so you can actually understand what's happening.

## Real Talk

This isn't just a demo. I built it to actually solve the problem of finding good prospects before your competitors do. The code is production-ready, the architecture scales, and it's already finding companies with 80+ GTM scores that are actively struggling with the exact problems Descope solves.

You could literally deploy this tomorrow and start using it to find better prospects than whatever you're doing now.
